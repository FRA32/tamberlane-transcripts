OFFSCREEN: <strong><em>Barely escaped with my life!!</em></strong>
ANTHONY: <em>Piper!</em>
[SFX: jingle jangle]

AINSLEY: Just the most <em>dreadful wailing...</em>
PIPER: What kind of ghost?
ANTHONY: Piper, don't be rude!

PIPER: Did it have big bitey teeth?
ANTHONY: Piper.

PIPER: I should tell you, I'm a professional ghost-catcher.
ANTHONY: Piper!

ANTHONY: <em>Piper-</em>
PIPER: ANTHONY, <strong><em>WHAT!</em></strong>

ANTHONY: Stop it! Can't you see they've gone through a lot!

TESS: Why don't you ask Walter for some tea for Ainsley?
PIPER: My talents are wasted.
