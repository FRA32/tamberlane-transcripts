OFFSCREEN: <em>BELFRY!</em>
BELFRY & TAMBERLANE: <em>AAHH!</em>

FOX: How many fingers am I holding up?
BELFRY: T...Two?

FOX: Whew! When I'd heard you fell down a cliff, I was worried!
FOX: But as usual, you defy expectations in the best way.

FOX: Since you don't appear to be concussed, I'm going to let Terra get some experience treating you.

FOX: In the meantime, I'll feed Parker. Hello, my love.
[SFX: weh mnnwuh muh]
TERRA: He definitely wants his mama.

BELFRY: Oh ho, you're finally letting your apprentice do your dirty work?

TERRA: Hey, now! I'm going to have to keep up with you, eventually!
