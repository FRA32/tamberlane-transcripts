TESS: Bel, what...?
HENRY: What <em>is</em> it?

OAKEWOOD: My new research project.
BELFRY: <em>MY TAMBERLANE!</em>

TESS: Oh, stars. Oh, stars, oh stars! Bel, you can't keep that thing!
BELFRY: I can, and I will.

TESS: Belfry, it's- It's <em>deformed.</em>
BELFRY: It's my <em>kit</em> now.

TESS: It has no fur! It's going to freeze in the winter! Can it even breathe with a muzzle that flat?
BELFRY: DON'T CARE! MY KIT!
