TESS: Belfry-

BELFRY: <em>NO!</em>

BELFRY: Don't you get it?! This kit is an <em>ORPHAN!</em>

BELFRY: Its parents <em>ABANDONED</em> it in the wilderness to <em>STARVE!</em>

BELFRY: And now you want me to do the <em>SAME THING?</em>

BELFRY: <em>NO PARENT SHOULD ABANDON THEIR KIT!</em>

BELFRY: And it <em>is</em> my kit now.

BELFRY: <em>I</em> won't abandon you.
